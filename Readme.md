# SendITCourier
SendIT is a courier service that helps users deliver parcels to different destinations, and it provides courier quotes based on weight categories. With this application, users are able to create orders, view all their orders, and they can cancel an order which is in transit, and update location i.e, destination of a parcel.

The app has an admin section, who is the super user and he/she can perform operations like changing the status of a parcel delivery order, and the present location of a parcel delivery order.

This Repo contains the UI (user interface) designs that I have implemented at this stage, that the user can interact with. I am in the process of implementing the core functionality(Backend), that will now enable the user to do operations like sign up, login,create an order.. 

You can view the user interface designs[Here](https://janetmugogo.github.io/SendITCourier/index.html).
